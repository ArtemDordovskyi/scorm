This is an example of a very basic SCORM package. It contains one SCO (example.html) and one Asset (this file) and a total of three files:

  - example.html
  - images/large/example.png
  - README

In addition to these it also contains an example manifest (imsmanifest.xml)
and a set of required XML schema files (adlcp_rootv1p2.xsd, ims_xml.xsd,
imscp_rootv1p1p2.xsd, imsmd_rootv1p2p1.xsd).

The README file is not explicitly specified in the manifest as an asset, but
is automatically included by the "scorm bundle" command.

The package is compatible with the "Content Aggregation Model" in SCORM 2004
3rd Edition.
